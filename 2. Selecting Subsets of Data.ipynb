Although it was versatile, it was ambiguous as labels can be integers as well as strings. Because of this ambiguity, the `loc` and `iloc` indexers were created which are explicit. \n",

If you are selecting rows 1, 2, and 5 along with columns age, favorite food and score you can call one indexer after another. This is called chained indexing and should be avoided at all costs."

But, they introduce the additional burden of having to remember what they do. Also, for most data analysis, the increase in performance isn't useful at all unless it's being done at scale. And if performance truly is an issue, then you place your data in NumPy arrays and use it directly."
